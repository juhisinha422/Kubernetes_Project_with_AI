ðŸ¤–AI + Kubernetes Project

Iâ€™m diving into an exciting AI + Kubernetes project thatâ€™s pushing my skills to the next level. Hereâ€™s what I learnt....

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
Iâ€™m using Amazon Q to set up a kubernetes-mcp-server. This allows me to automate Kubernetes deployments using general-purpose commands to streamline the entire process and deploy my project seamlessly.

Hereâ€™s my step-by-step plan:
1. Set up Amazon Q.
2. Configure Kubernetes MCP Server (create a file mcp.json in the .aws/amazonq directory and add the Kubernetes MCP server code from the GitHub repository).
3. Install essential tools like kubectl, Docker, and Minikube.
4. Write general-purpose commands to set up Kubernetes.
5. Pull the necessary image from the DockerHub repository.
6. Expose the ports and deploy it locally.
7. If using AWS EC2, expose the ports accordingly.
8. Finally, hit the URL in your browser to access the deployed application! ðŸš€
